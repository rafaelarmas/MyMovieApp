# MyMovieApp

API and React UI that allows a user to query a movie database. Movies can be searched by title/name keyword, genre, and can be filtered by a number of results per page.

### Database

The data for this app can be found here:

### Future Development

I hope to add future features, such as, filtering by actors or sorting movies by title/release date.
